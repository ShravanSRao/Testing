                    <li>I tried making the pages responsive around the with of 500-600px ,as you noticed there are section in this page named slide1,slide2,slide3 etc
                        I made the navbar responsive at 5** pixels so it switches from all navbar options[Home,about us etc] to just name of  the page so later when i created the slide 2 i thought of making it responsive using the same media screen tag but for some reason it doesnt work
                        <p>Note : i commented that line in the css 
                        file ,around line 86</p>

                        Has the source of the website stopped functioning ?
                    Are there any alternatives which gives random pictures ?</li>
                    <li>I felt the color combination of the website is a not upto the mark 
                        <p>Where can i learn about colour combiantion and other things</p>

                <p>When i get stuck in some problem i used to ask chatgpt to search for tags that can solve my problem </p>
                <p>Example:I wanted 4 cards in slide1 i wanted 2 cards to be ia line and the next two below it But intially when i tried i was getting all four in the same line </p>
                <p>
                    So i gave the prompt in chatgt it suggested me to use flex-wrap {I was unaware of this before}
                </p>
                <p>So chatgpt was very helpful in solving certain problems and achiving what i was trying to do </p>
